              I am bilingual, I speak spanish and english fluently. I studied
              English when I was 13 years old, something that opened and
              continues to open many doors in my life into this beautiful world.
              At 17 years old, I decided to study computer and systems
              engineering at the Dominican O&amp;M University, which I graduated
              at 22 years old with honors.
            </p>
            <p>
              🕵 Everyday, I enjoy and love challenges, overcoming them
              motivates me to continue learning and makes me a better
              professional. 💖 I fall in love in programming every time, it's
              like a deja vu🥰 and I try to incorporate it in some way in
              everything that I do. 😎 Also, I have a lot of hobbies, such as
              traveling, listening to music, reading, ride bicycle, watching TV
              shows, drinking beer, and others.
